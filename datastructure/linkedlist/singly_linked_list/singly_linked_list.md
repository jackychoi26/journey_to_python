# Singly Linked List
## What is a Singly linked list
> Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

## Why we need this?
The advantages of linked list are as follows
1. Dynamic size
- The size of a linked list can be allocated and deallocated at run time.
2. Ease of insertion / Deletion
- It is `O(1)`
