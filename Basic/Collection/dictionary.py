# A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to
# a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A
# keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact,
# you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
print(alien_0['color']) # >> 'green'
