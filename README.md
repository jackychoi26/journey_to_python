# What is this repo about?
This is a Python learner's cookbook. Fundamental programming knowledge is required to understand the stuff here. This cookbook will introduce one concept in each .py file. They are mostly the concepts that I ran into writing Python code.

## How to make the most out of it?
VSCode is highly recommended as this is the text editor I use for this cookbook.
You can install a Python extension and make changes to the code and run the code to see what happened.

## Personal thought
I don't quite like Python for the following reasons:
1. It uses indentation for code block, which I don't see any added benefits.
2. It uses underscores instead of camelCase for variables. WHY?
3. Its typing system is weak.

This is written on 1 Oct 2024. I learn it because Python has become one of the most needed skill on the market, not because I like it. That's life.
